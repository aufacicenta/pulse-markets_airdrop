# Aurora Airdrop Contract

This flattened `PaymentSplitter.sol` contract should work in https://remix.ethereum.org/

Simply:

1. Load `./contracts/Airdrop.sol` into Remix IDE
2. Compile with a Solidity ^0.8.0 compiler
3. No errors should be logged
4. Connect to the Aurora Testnet network via metamask
5. Deploy the contract and interact with it

## Mainnet Deployment

First, set your `.env` file values:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=...
```

In the CLI, run:

```
source .env
npx hardhat run --network aurora scripts/deploy.ts
```

Done.
